[HTML/CSS] Building a Website for % Telecom Company  

The name of the wesite is % Telecome.  
% Telecome is a High-Speed Internet Provider with several types of product provided to the customer.  
The inspiration comes from the elements in the https://thenounproject.com/ therefore the main tone chosen is black and white.    

For the mainpage. There are several navigation buttons in the header using the hover and hover active to change the color and position of the buttons.  
The same applies to lots of icons, buttons, text and banners throughout the website.   
The opacity will change as well when necessary. The portfolio photo of the customer will zoom in when the mouse hover over it.    

Also, anchor tags on the navigation buttons and drop down menu are applied to link to the specific area of content on the page, and a smooth scroll-behavior is applied as well.  
The page will automatically scroll down to the corresponding section in a smooth way.     

For contact section, we can send infomation by clicking <send message> button and then a popup alert will display.    

For those navigation buttons, the media queries are applied to enable the flex-direction changing from row to column and vice-versa.    

A Christmas Countdown on the top-left of the website is written in JavaScript in the mainpage to show the days, hours minutes and seconds left before Christmas arrives.    

The login page and the signup page are also used the same responsive design.
